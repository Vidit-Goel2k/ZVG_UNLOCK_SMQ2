# Usage Guide for ZVG Unlock SMQ2

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to use the **ZVG Unlock SMQ2** program to identify and unlock stuck inbound queues from SMQ2.

## Prerequisites

Before using this program, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **SAP System Access**: You should have access to the SAP system where the queues need to be unlocked.
2. **Authorization**: Ensure you have sufficient authorizations to read from `TRFCQVIEW` table and execute the functions `TRFC_QIN_GET_CURRENT_QUEUES` and `TRFC_QIN_DELETE_LUW`.
3. **Queue Monitoring Knowledge**: Familiarity with SAP's queue monitoring tools, such as transaction `SMQ2`, is recommended.

## Running the Program

Follow these steps to execute the **ZVG Unlock SMQ2** program:

### Step 1: Access the Program

1. Log in to the SAP system.
2. In the SAP GUI, go to transaction code **SE38** (ABAP Editor).
3. Enter the program name: **ZVG_UNLOCK_SMQ2**.
4. Click the **Execute** button (F8).

### Step 2: Monitor Output

Once the program starts running, you will see the following outputs:

1. **Stuck Queues Found**: The program will display the number of stuck queues found in SMQ2 and begin processing them.
   
   Example:
   ```
   Stuck queues found: 5 - Starting processing.
   ```

2. **Queue Processing**: For each queue being processed, the program will show the following:
   - **Queue Name**: The name of the queue being processed.
   - **Success or Failure**: Whether the queue was unlocked successfully or not.
   
   Example:
   ```
   Processing Queue: ZMQ1
   Queue unlocked successfully: ZMQ1
   ```

3. **Completion**: After processing, the program will display the number of queues successfully unlocked in the current iteration.

   Example:
   ```
   3 queues unlocked in this iteration.
   ```

4. **Exit**: If there are no stuck queues, the program will display the following message and exit:
   ```
   No stuck queues found. All queues are cleared.
   ```

### Step 3: Review Logs and Results

After execution, you can review the results:
- **Successful Unlock**: Queues that were successfully unlocked will show "Queue unlocked successfully."
- **Failure to Unlock**: Queues that could not be unlocked will show "Failed to unlock queue."

If there is an issue, check the **system logs** (transaction `SM21` or `ST22`) for any additional details or errors that might have occurred.

## Example Output

```
Stuck queues found: 2 - Starting processing.
Processing Queue: ZMQ1
Queue unlocked successfully: ZMQ1
Processing Queue: ZMQ2
Queue unlocked successfully: ZMQ2
2 queues unlocked in this iteration.
```

## Configuration

The **ZVG Unlock SMQ2** program does not require any external configuration. It works with the default SAP system configuration for queue monitoring.

However, if your system has custom configurations or specific error handling requirements, make sure the program is aligned with them.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during execution, refer to the [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) document for common problems and their solutions.

## Advanced Usage

### Running the Program in the Background

If you need to process queues without manual intervention, you can run the program in the background:

1. Go to transaction **SE38** (ABAP Editor).
2. Enter the program name: **ZVG_UNLOCK_SMQ2**.
3. Click on **Program** in the menu bar and select **Execute in Background**.
4. Set the desired options (e.g., time of execution) and click **Execute**.

This will run the program in the background and process the queues automatically.

### Scheduling the Program

If you want to schedule the program to run periodically, use transaction **SM36** (Define Background Job) to schedule the job:

1. Go to transaction **SM36**.
2. Enter a job name and select **ABAP program**.
3. In the **Program** field, enter **ZVG_UNLOCK_SMQ2**.
4. Set the frequency and timing of the job.
5. Save and schedule the job.

This will allow the program to run at specified intervals and keep the queues processed without manual intervention.
