# Unlock SMQ2 Stuck Queues

## Overview
This repository contains a custom ABAP program (`ZVG_UNLOCK_SMQ2`) to identify and unlock stuck inbound queues in transaction SMQ2. It automates the queue-unlocking process, which is typically done manually, saving significant time and effort for SAP administrators.

### Key Features
- Automatically identifies stuck inbound queues in SMQ2.
- Unlocks the queues programmatically using transaction IDs (TIDs).
- Logs progress and results after each iteration.
- Exits gracefully when all queues are cleared.

---

## Prerequisites
To use this program, you need:

1. Access to an SAP system with developer rights.
2. Authorization to create or run custom ABAP reports.
3. Understanding of inbound queues and the SMQ2 transaction.

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/unlock-smq2.git
   ```

2. **Upload the ABAP Code:**
   - Open the ABAP Editor (transaction SE38 or SE80) in your SAP system.
   - Create a new program with the name `ZVG_UNLOCK_SMQ2`.
   - Copy and paste the contents of the `ZVG_UNLOCK_SMQ2.abap` file into the editor.
   - Save and activate the program.

---

## Usage

1. **Run the Program:**
   - Execute the program `ZVG_UNLOCK_SMQ2` in transaction SE38 or SA38.

2. **Monitor Progress:**
   - The program will log information about the queues being processed and display the results in the output.

3. **Completion:**
   - Once all stuck queues are cleared, the program will exit with a confirmation message.

---

## Example Output
```plaintext
Stuck queues found: 3 - Starting processing.
Processing Queue: QUEUE_1
Queue unlocked successfully: QUEUE_1
Processing Queue: QUEUE_2
Queue unlocked successfully: QUEUE_2
Processing Queue: QUEUE_3
Failed to unlock queue: QUEUE_3
2 queues unlocked in this iteration.
No stuck queues found. All queues are cleared.
```

### Guide: Debugging Common Issues

#### Issue: "No authorization to execute function module"
- Ensure the user executing the program has the required authorizations for the function modules used.
- Contact your SAP Basis team to adjust authorizations if needed.

#### Issue: "Queue not unlocked despite successful TID fetch"
- Verify if the TID fetched belongs to the correct queue.
- Check for underlying errors in the SMQ2 transaction or system logs (transaction SM21).

#### Issue: "Network-related errors"
- Ensure stable network connectivity between the application server and the database.
- Coordinate with your network or Basis team to resolve potential connectivity issues.

#### Issue: "System-level problems"
- Check for locked resources or contention issues at the system level.
- Look for logs in transactions SM21 or ST22 to identify and resolve system errors.
